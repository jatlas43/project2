			<p> Even if Roblox has a safe-chat filter, people can still find loopholes and workarounds that can still get to other players.

			<p> Many of the scams on Roblox usually end up getting your account banned or even deleted due to you not having any control over the account, which is very bad.
			</div>
			<div class="ev18">
			<img src="friendblox.jpg">
