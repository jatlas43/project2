			<p> One of the many great things about Minecraft is the many servers to go on. People work hard on these and you can play many different games most of the time.</p>

			<div class="ev2">
			<img src="village.jpg">
			<p> In Minecraft, you can find peaceful villages filled with cute animals and great resources, emulating travels in real life.

			<div class="ev3">
			<img src="skins.jpg">
			<p> You can choose many skins in Minecraft and most of them are free. However, there are a few that require you to pay with real money, but in very cheap amounts.

			<p> Minecraft, despite being launched almost a decade ago, is still receiving updates, including this one, making the water more colorful and beautiful than ever before, as well as adding new creatures that live in the water.

			<p> This game encourages creativity, which is why a creative mode exists where you can fly around and build to your heart's content with every block in the game to make cool structures, like this one.

			<p> Despite having a mostly singleplayer focus, Minecraft can be played with friends on different computes or devices, which is a really fun experience most of the time.
			</div>
			<div class="ev8">
			<img src="mariocraft.jpg">
			<p> Minecraft is also available on Nintendo systems, giving you a Mario-themed texture pack and skins for free with the purchase of the game, making it even more fun.
			</div>
			<div class="ev9">
			<img src="pixelmon.jpg">
			<p> Lastly, Minecraft mods add so much more to the game. It can be a simple-item mod, or a whole story based around a mod. Regardless of what you do, it can be anything you want it to be, like this mod right here which brought Pokemon into Minecraft, although it was sadly shut down.
