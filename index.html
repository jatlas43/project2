				<h1>Minecraft is better than Roblox</h1>
				<h2>Hi! I'm Jackson Atlas! I'm sure you have all heard of the magnificent game known as Minecraft. Maybe you've wanted to play it, maybe you have played it, maybe your kids want it. It's a spectacular game, but there are people who make the claim that a similar game, Roblox, is better, and I'm here to quash those opinions in a well-constructed argument. If you want to see the different arguments, then scroll down below to see the links to these pages. You won't regret it!</h2>
