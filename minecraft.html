				<p>Minecraft is better than Roblox, and I'll tell you why right now. Before we get into that, however, we have to look back on the history of Minecraft. Minecraft was released to the public way back in 2009. At the time, the game was a simple survival game where you could, well, mine and craft. While it was pretty simple at the time, the game was still in development. It eventually started to go through an alpha phase, where lots of new things were added. Lots of changes came about, such as adding survival and creative modes, new animals and enemies, new potions, new blocks, new EVERYTHING! Since the game encourages creativity and exploration with the ability for players to build cool structures, it has been a huge success. The game has been getting updates to this day even after its release almost 10 years ago. Now, let's compare it to Roblox. Even if Roblox is older, it doesn't necessarily mean that its better. While Minecraft can be played by yourself or with friends, Roblox doesn't have many single-player games. Not only that, the servers are WAY different. Minecraft servers are places where you can chat with friends, play games, meet new people, and do other cool things. Roblox servers, on the other hand, can be filed with people who are disrespectful and can do bad things. While Minecraft does occasionally get people like that, Roblox tries to cover it up by implementing a swear filter which blocks out profane words with hashtags (# These things). However, it doesn't really help as you can still get the gist as to what people are saying, and sometimes, completely normal words are replaced with hashtags for no reason! And, to top it all off, reporting someone in Roblox isn't even really an option, as most of the reports are ignored, and people can still find other ways to harass players. Minecraft takes care of things like this with instant server bans, and the ability to mute people. Sure, the server bans may seem a little strict, but would you rather have someone sitting right next to you calling you something offensive, or have them banned almost instantly? It's not a very difficult choice. Unfortunately, no game is perfect, and that applies to Minecraft as well. One of the only advantages that Roblox has over Minecraft is that Minecraft on PC costs around 25 to 30 US Dollars, while Roblox is absolutely free. This in no way meas that Roblox is instantly better, but that isn't the end of the argument, as we have to talk about the Roblox side.</p>
