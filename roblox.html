			<p>Roblox. It's pretty mediocre. It looks even worse when you compare it to a game as wonderful as Minecraft. However, there are a FEW upsides to Roblox, so lets look at them, as well as the history of Roblox itself. Roblox was first released in 2006, as an MMO (a Massively Multiplayer Online game). It garnered some attention fairly quickly, and got a lot of people playing it. You could use the Studio program to create your own game, or "place". Just like creating a Minecraft server, it takes a strenuous amount of effort, but in the end, it's worth it. Plus, you can make friends on Roblox and chat with them outside of games if they are online. There are also special events where you can get cool items, and Roblox itself occasionally receive updates to stop bug fixes and such. However, what makes this, in my opinion, worse than Minecraft? Well, one thing that this game has that Minecraft doesn't is an in-game currency, called "Robux". These Robux can only be obtained by purchasing them with REAL money, or by buying a membership pass, called "Builder's Club", which ALSO costs real money. People without the access to buy Robux, are unable to purchase most things from the store, or "Catalog", leaving them with only default clothes, and things that can be bought for free on the store, of which there is a small handful. This, in turn, cause people with anything other than default clothes to call the people with default clothes names, like "Bacon Hairs" (based on the way the default hair looks). While not everyone does this, there are quite a few. Another thing that Roblox has are SCAMS. Games will often advertise free Robux or other things, and when someone unknowingly enters it, thinking that they'll get rich, they enter their Roblox username and password, and have their account stolen from them, as well as everything they own on said account. Minecraft doesn't have these kinds of things, although they aren't fully scam-free either. As for upsides, Roblox is free to start, whereas Minecraft costs quite a bit of money to get on many different platforms. However, this is often overlooked by all the purchases you can make in Roblox. These are only a FEW reasons as to why Roblox is worse than Minecraft.</p>
