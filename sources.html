			<h1>Minecraft vs Roblox: Final Summary</h1>
			<p>So after all of that evidence, how do I feel about Minecraft and Roblox? Well, I believe that Minecraft, has been, still is, and will always be, superior to the likes of Roblox. To state it bluntly, Minecraft has more multiplayer content, as well as single player content, constant updates that improve the game's quality, the constant encouragement of creativity and exploration, and more. Roblox has a bad chat filter, almost NO singleplayer content, too many in-game purchases and scams for in-game currency, updates that don't really fix a lot, and more. One of the only triumphs Roblox has over Minecraft is the fact that it's free. However, Minecraft's communities are better than Roblox's, more friendly, and more welcoming. Not only that, but Minecraft is actually WORTH its money. With that out of the way, I'd like to say thank you to viewing my site, and before I finish this, I'd like to say one more thing. Throw Roblox in the trash, and play Minecraft today!</p>
